//List can store the value and address
//grow and shrink advantage

//Advantage of an array  -->
// array  have sequential memory  101 105 109 113 ....
//we don't intialized a memory dynamically in array
// from starting position of an array  --- > indx position * size of data structure
// 101 + 2*4 ;
//113

//list is dynamic
// array is fast
//where we know exact element used array else used list
